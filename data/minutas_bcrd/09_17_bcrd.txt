At its monetary policy meeting for September 2017, the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (BCRD) decided to maintain its monetary policy interest rate at 5.25% per annum.

The decision on the reference rate was taken after a comprehensive review of the balance of risks around the inflation projections, including the evolution of the main national macroeconomic indicators, the international environment relevant to the Dominican economy and the expectations of the domestic market . The monthly rate of inflation in the month of August amounted to 0.57%, so the accumulated rate to the eighth month of the year stood at 1.77%. Likewise, year-on-year inflation climbed to 3.18%, placing it within the target range of 4.0% ± 1.0% of the Monetary Program. Additionally, core inflation, which reflects the monetary conditions of the economy, amounted to 2.27% year-on-year. The projections indicate that inflation would remain within the target range at the end of the year.

In the external context, the advanced economies experience an acceleration in their growth for the sixth consecutive quarter. The outlook is favorable for the United States of America (USA), the Euro Zone (ZE) and Japan. According to the Consensus Forecast, the US would grow 2.2% in 2017, after the annualized interquarterly growth of April-June, which reached 3.1%, was revised upwards. By 2018, the US is projected to grow 2.4%, in a context of normalization of monetary policy. As for the EZ, it is projected that the product would expand by 2.1% in 2017 and 1.8% in 2018. The dynamism of the advanced economies would have a positive impact on world economic activity, which would grow 3.0% in 2017 and 3.1% in 2018. It should be noted that the inflationary pressures of the developed economies remain relatively low, projecting 2.0% for the US in 2017 and 1.9% in 2018, as well as inflation rates of 1.5% in 2017 and 1.3% in 2018 for the ZE.
On the other hand, in Latin America (AL) there continues to be a gradual economic recovery, with the exception of Venezuela. In the case of Brazil, the largest economy in the region, it would grow 0.7% in 2017 and 2.3% in 2018. On the other hand, Mexico would expand 2.2% in both years, while Chile would grow 1.4% in 2017 and 2.9% in 2018 The projections for Latin America have been revised upwards and reflect that the economy of the region would expand 1.7% in 2017 and 2.6% in 2018, driven by more favorable terms of trade.

In the domestic sphere, economic activity reacted favorably after the expansionary measures taken at the end of July, such as the reduction of the monetary policy rate by 50 basis points and the reduction in the legal reserve by 2.2 percentage points. It should be noted that credit to the private sector in national currency has increased by RD $ 16,000 million since these measures were taken, so that positive prospects remain for the revitalization of domestic demand for the rest of 2017. In that sense, Growth is expected to approach its potential by the end of the year, even in a context of recovery from the damage caused by recent climate events. It is important to note that the World Bank approved a loan of US $ 150 million for the Dominican Republic with the purpose of facing natural disasters, which would facilitate the reactivation of economic activity during the last quarter of the year.
In the fiscal sector, a boost to public spending was recently announced, implying a more active fiscal policy for the rest of the year. Notwithstanding this decision, the Government announced that it would meet the deficit target of 2.3% of GDP, established in the National Budget for 2017. On the other hand, the external sector maintains its dynamism, contributing to the increase of foreign exchange earnings and creating a favorable environment for the relative stability of the foreign exchange market and for the accumulation of international reserves.

The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic reaffirms its commitment to conduct monetary policy to achieve its inflation target and maintain macroeconomic stability. In that sense, it will continue to monitor the evolution of the world economy and the domestic situation, in order to adopt the necessary measures against possible risks on price stability and the proper functioning of the financial and payment systems.
