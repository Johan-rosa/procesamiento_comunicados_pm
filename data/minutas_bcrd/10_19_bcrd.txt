BCRD maintains its monetary policy rate at 4.50% per year
At its monetary policy meeting in October 2019, the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (BCRD) decided to keep its monetary policy interest rate at 4.50% per annum.

The benchmark decision is based on detailed risk balance analysis for inflation forecasts, including international and domestic macroeconomic indicators, market expectations and medium-term projections. September's monthly inflation was 0.38%, while cumulative inflation in the first nine months of the year stood at 2.38%. On the other hand, year-on-year inflation, i.e. from September 2018 to September 2019, stood at 2.02%, remaining below the lower bound of the target range. Underlying inflation, reflecting monetary conditions, stood at 2.14% in September. Inflation expectations from economic analysts and the BCRD forecasting system indicate that inflation would be closer to the heart of the target range of 4.0% x 1.0% at the end of 2019 and would remain around the core value of the target during 2020.

In the international environment, the pockets of uncertainty that have been gravitating this year persist, particularly those related to trade disputes between the United States of America (USA) and China, as well as socio-political tensions in different parts of the world. Against this convulsing outlook, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) corrected its growth projections downwards, estimating an expansion of the global economy of 3.0% in 2019, the lowest in a decade, and a slight recovery to 3.4% in 2020.

The U.S. growth outlook has moderated, rising at 2.4% for 2019 and 2.1% by 2020 according to the IMF, influenced by a slowdown in private investment, the dissipation of the effects of fiscal stimulus, and the impact of trade war. Taking into account the lower dynamism of economic activity and low inflationary pressures, the Federal Reserve decreased its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points in October, for the third consecutive time. In addition, the Federal Reserve has been providing greater liquidity to the financial system through repurchase agreements (REPOS) and Treasury bill purchases on the secondary market, with the goal of lowering short-term interest rates and normalizing the yield curve, which had been reversed in recent months reflecting short-term interest rates higher than long-term interest rates. Based on the content of the Fed's latest press release, market analysts anticipate a pause in the process of lowering federal fund interest rates in the coming months.

In this sense, these monetary easing measures have been meeting the objective of stimulating domestic demand, with reductions in the benchmark interest rate that have even been higher than those implemented by the Federal Reserve, which was decisive in the Decision of the Open Market Operations Committee to keep the monetary policy rate unchanged. Expansive monetary conditions are helping the economy remain the region's leader in growth, in a context of price stability. Given the global low interest rate and high uncertainty environment, the strength of macroeconomic fundamentals exhibited by the Dominican Republic places the country as an attractive destination for international investors.

In the external sector, foreign exchange-generating activities such as foreign direct investment and remittances continue to perform well, compensating for recent tourism moderation. The flow of tourists is expected to recover to normal in the coming months, to which the recent announcement of the FBI investigation into adverse events in the sector a few months ago will contribute.

Importantly, the increased exchange rate volatility experienced in recent months is not associated with macroeconomic fundamentals, but rather to the complex international environment described and the uncertainty of the domestic electoral process that has caused some apprehension in some economic sectors. In this regard, the Central Bank maintains high levels of international reserves and has put the electronic forex platform into operation, which will contribute to greater transparency and efficiency in the foreign exchange market, as well as better training of the expectations of private actors. In addition, the balance of payments current account is expected to close the year with a deficit of about 1.6% of GDP, below its historical average and that high levels of capital flows will remain.

The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic reaffirms its commitment to drive monetary policy towards achieving its inflation target and the smooth functioning of financial and payment systems, thus contributing to the maintenance of macroeconomic stability. In this sense, the institution will continue to monitor the moderation of the world economy and factors of uncertainty both externally and internally and its impact on aggregate demand, being prepared to continue to react in a timely manner to factors that may generate deviations from the inflation target and affect Dominican economic growth.
