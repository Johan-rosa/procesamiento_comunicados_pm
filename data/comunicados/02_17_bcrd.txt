At its monetary policy meeting for the month of February 2017, the BCRD decided to maintain the monetary policy rate (MPR) at 5.50% per annum.

The decision on the benchmark interest rate was adopted after a weighted analysis of the balance of risks around the inflation projections, as well as the state of the economy based on its main indicators, market expectations and the international environment relevant. In the month of January, the monthly inflation was 0.62%, while the interannual inflation rate rose to 2.33%. Likewise, core inflation, related to the monetary conditions of the economy, was 1.89%. According to projections, inflation would converge to the goal of 4% ± 1% in the first half of this year.

In the international context, according to Consensus Forecast, the world economy would grow 2.8% in 2017, with an expected expansion of around 2.9% by 2018, in line with better growth projections for the United States of America (USA) and with a better expected performance in some emerging economies. In the case of the US, this year's growth would close around 2.3%, improving to 2.4% by 2018. On the other hand, real production in the Euro Zone (ZE) would grow 1.6% in 2017 and 1.5% in 2018. Inflation in these industrialized economies would remain positive, gradually approaching the long-term trend levels. In that sense, inflation rates of 2.5% are expected for the US and 1.6% for the ZE in 2017. By 2018, inflation would be around 2.3% in the US and 1.4% in the ZE. In the case of Latin America, after a fall of GDP of -0.5% in 2016, the region would begin the recovery of economic growth in 2017 by projecting an expansion of 1.6%, improving to 2.5% in 2018.
International prices of primary goods tend towards levels higher than last year's average, especially oil, industrial metals and some foods. It is expected that the normalization process of the US Federal Reserve will continue, increasing the interest rate differential with other industrialized economies, which would continue to drive a path of strengthening the dollar in international markets.

In the domestic sphere, the economy reached an expansion of 6.6% in real terms in 2016, projected growth of around 5.5% for 2017, above its potential and the Latin American average. Credit to the private sector in national currency continues to grow around 12% year-on-year in February, gradually converging to the projected expansion for the nominal product in the current year. The current account of the balance of payments closed with a deficit of 1.5% of GDP in 2016 and the fiscal deficit of the Central Government presented a preliminary record around the stipulated in the modified budget for 2016. These indicators indicate that they have been followed strengthening the foundations of the Dominican economy.

The Central Bank reaffirms its commitment to continue conducting monetary policy aimed at achieving its inflation target and maintaining macroeconomic stability, while continuing to monitor the evolution of the world economy and the domestic situation, in order to adopt the necessary measures against possible risks on price stability and the proper functioning of the financial and payment systems.
